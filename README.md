# Intelligent Registration System Automation

This project contains a **Registration Form** built with HTML/CSS/JS and an automation script using **Python** and **Selenium WebDriver** to verify its functionality. This was developed as part of the Frugal Testing Software Engineer assignment.

## 📂 Project Structure
* `index.html`: The registration form web page.
* `style.css`: Styling for the form (includes responsive design).
* `script.js`: Validation logic (Phone, Email, Password Strength).
* `test_automation.py`: The Selenium Python script that automates the testing scenarios.

## 🚀 Prerequisites
Before running the automation script, ensure you have Python installed. You also need to install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install selenium webdriver-manager
